        <p class="first">Each <em>Climate</em> <em>Equity Scorecards system</em> compares a country&#8217;s <a href="#">mitigation pledge</a> to its estimated <a href="http://gdrights.org/scorecard/glossary.php#gloss_fair">fair share</a> of the <a href="#">global mitigation needed to stabilize the climate</a>. A country whose mitigation pledge is equal to its fair share would receive a score of &#8220;100%&#8221;. (A score lower than 100% means the country has pledged to do less than its fair share, and one that is higher than 100% means it has pledged to do more than its fair share.)</p>
        <h3>Mitigation Pledges</h3>
        <p>The <em>Climate Equity Scorecards</em> system assesses the national mitigation pledges that countries have submitted to UNFCCC Secretariat, which are typically referred to as &#8220;Copenhagen pledges.&#8221; (The official <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/copenhagen_dec_2009/items/5264.php">Annex 1 submissions</a> and <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_15/copenhagen_accord/items/5265.php">non-Annex 1 submissions</a> are available on the UNFCCC website, and a helpful synthesis is available on the <a href="http://climateactiontracker.org/countries.html">Climate Action Tracker website</a>, and in spreadsheet form at the <a href="http://climateinteractive.org/scoreboard">Climate Interactive website</a>.) It reports scores for the year 2020, because that is the year for which countries have consistently reported their pledges. In many cases, countries have submitted both an &#8220;unconditional&#8221; pledge, which they intend to meet unilaterally, and a more ambitious &#8220;conditional&#8221; pledge, which is contingent on other countries raising their own mitigation ambition and/or providing financial and technological support. Under &#8220;Type of Pledge&#8221; on the panel to the left of the scorecard, click either &#8220;Unconditional&#8221; or &#8220;Conditional&#8221; to display the corresponding score. (Note, the Scorecards system accounts for mitigation pledges only, not financing pledges, because of the absence of confirmed financing commitments.)</p>
        <h3>Fair Shares</h3>
        <p>The country&#8217;s estimated fair share is based on the Greenhouse Development Rights (GDRs) effort-sharing framework, and is based on straightforward and plausible measures of the <a href="http://gdrights.org/scorecard/glossary.php#gloss_responsibility">responsibility</a> and <a href="http://gdrights.org/scorecard/glossary.php#gloss_capacity">capacity</a> of each country to contribute to the global effort to stabilize the climate. GDRs attempts to provide specificity and transparency to the UNFCCC equity principles of &#8220;common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.&#8221; While there is no reason to assume that Parties will ultimately negotiate and adopt a single, simple formula to reflect equitable burden-sharing, it is still helpful to have an easily understood and justified &#8220;equity reference framework.&#8221; Against such a benchmark, pledges can be assessed, expectations can be set, and civil society can put forward national demands that are consistent with science and equity.</p>
        <p>Note: a click on &#8220;more detailed results for this country&#8221; will open the underlying Greenhouse Development Rights calculator, which provided much more detail, and allows you to examine and adjust key assumptions and parameters.</p>
        <h3>Global mitigation needed to stabilize the climate</h3>
        <p>The global mitigation needed to stabilize the climate depends on which global pathway is selected under &#8220;Level of Global Ambition&#8221; on the panel to the left of the scorecard. &#8220;AOSIS&#8221; is the most ambitious of the three; &#8220;IPCC 2°C Likely (barely)&#8221; is medium ambition, and 2°C coin-flip is least ambitious. Respectively, they require 16 GtCO2eq, 9.5 GtCO2eq, or 3.5 GtCO2eq of reductions relative to BAU in 2020, and have approximately 25%, 33%, and 50% chance of exceeding 2°C (according to the analysis of Meinshausen et. al. (2009)). (For more information, see the <a href="#link">Global Mitigation Pathways Overview</a>.)</p>
        <h2>Some examples of National Climate equity scores</h2>
        <img src="img/ex-usa.png" width="890" height="518" alt="example scorecard: USA AOSIS conditional" />
        <p>The Scorecard reports the United States&#8217; high level of capacity and responsibility (34% and 33%, respectively, of total global responsibility and capacity), as calculated by the GDRs framework. Simply averaging these two figures, the United States&#8217; fair share works out to approximately 3.6 GtCO2eq out of the 11 GtCO2eq total global mitigation required to keep to the &#8220;AOSIS pathway.&#8221;</p>
        <p>The United States pledge &#8211; &#8220;to reduce total emissions by 17% compared to 2005&#8221; &#8211; amounts to only 0.85 GtCO2eq of reductions in 2020. Thus, the US has pledged to do only 24% ( = 0.85 / 3.6 ) of its fair share.</p>
        <p>If one selects the less ambitious &#8220;IPCC 2°C likely (barely) pathway,&#8221; or the even less ambitious &#8220;2°C coin flip pathway,&#8221; each of which require progressively less global mitigation, the US pledge earns correspondingly higher scores. On the other hand, the United States receives no score if &#8220;Unconditional&#8221; pledge is selected, since it has offered only a conditional pledge.</p>
        <p>Note: a click on &#8220;more detailed results for this country&#8221; will open the underlying Greenhouse Development Rights calculator, which provided much more detail, and allows you to examine and adjust key assumptions and parameters.</p>
        <img src="img/ex-norway.png" width="890" height="543" alt="example scorecard: Norway IPCC 2° Likely (barely) unconditional" />
        <p>Norway has made a more ambitious pledge than the United States (30% below its 1990 emission level). This pledge amounts to reductions of approximately 40 MtCO2eq. This pledge, evaluated against the same &#8220;AOSIS pathway&#8221; that is shown in the United States example above, would amount to 71% of its fair share. While this doesn&#8217;t quite meet Norway&#8217;s fair share,&#8221; you can see here that under the less ambitious &#8220;IPCC 2°C likely (barely) pathway&#8221; it does so with room to spare. Under the still less ambitious &#8220;2°C coin flip pathway,&#8221; Norway&#8217;s pledge greatly exceeds (more than three-fold) its fair share.</p>
        <img src="img/ex-china.png" width="890" height="598" alt="example scorecard: China AOSIS unconditional" />
        <p>China has offered a pledge that is large relative to its capacity and responsibility even in the stringent terms of the &#8220;AOSIS&#8221; pathway. (Under the two lower ambition global pathways, it is even more evident that China is proposing to do more than its fair share.)</p>
        <p>Note: this does not mean that China&#8217;s mitigation pledge exhausts its mitigation potential. This is clear when one clicks &#8220;more detailed results for this country&#8221; to go to the underlying GDRs Calculator, and examines the graph presented in China&#8217;s &#8220;Country Report.&#8221; The Chinese emissions reduction pathway that would be consistent with even the low-stringency global &#8220;2°C coin flip pathway&#8221; would require far more mitigation than even the very large amount (relative to its Responsibility and Capacity) that China has pledged. This additional mitigation would need to be financed by those countries (with very high responsibility and capacity) whose fair share exceeds their domestic mitigation potential.</p>
        <img src="img/ex-india.png" width="890" height="537" alt="example scorecard: India AOSIS unconditional" />
        <p>India, despite being a very populous country, has less than 1% of global responsibility and global capacity, which is not surprisingly as it is also an extremely poor country. Its pledge, however (to reduce emissions intensity by 25% compared to 2005 levels) implies reductions in emissions intensity that are no greater than what would be expected as a results of business-as-usual efficiency improvements. Given this, the Scorecards system assigns India a score of zero, as befits a pledge that amounts to no additional effort beyond BAU. The same result appears for Russia, Ukraine and other countries.
